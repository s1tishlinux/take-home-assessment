# Important Notes for Candidates

## Mock Environment Setup

This assessment uses **simulated/mock infrastructure** - you won't have access to real databases or deployment environments. This is intentional and normal for take-home assessments.

## What We're Testing

We're evaluating your **code quality, problem-solving approach, and MLOps understanding** - not your ability to manage actual infrastructure.

## How to Handle External Dependencies

### Database Operations
- **Fix security issues** (hardcoded credentials, missing SSL)
- **Add proper error handling** for connection failures
- **Implement retry logic** and connection pooling concepts
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Add logging** for debugging

Example approach:
```python
try:
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        os.environ['DATABASE_URL'],
        sslmode='require',
        connect_timeout=10
    )
    # Your database operations here
except psycopg2.Error as e:
    logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
    # Handle gracefully - don't crash the deployment
```

### API Calls
- **Add retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Handle timeouts** and network failures
- **Validate API responses** before proceeding
- **Log all API interactions** for monitoring

### Health Checks
- The health check URLs won't be accessible - this is expected
- **Show how you would handle** health check failures
- **Implement proper monitoring** and alerting concepts

## Focus Areas

✅ **Security**: Remove hardcoded secrets, add proper authentication  
✅ **Reliability**: Add error handling, retries, validation  
✅ **Code Quality**: Clean structure, proper logging, testability  
✅ **MLOps Understanding**: Show knowledge of deployment best practices  

## What NOT to Worry About

❌ Don't try to set up real databases or APIs  
❌ Don't worry about the external services being unreachable  
❌ Don't spend time on actual infrastructure provisioning  

## Success Criteria

Your **code should demonstrate** that you:
- Understand the security vulnerabilities and fix them
- Know how to handle failures gracefully  
- Can structure code for production reliability
- Understand MLOps deployment concepts

**Remember**: We're hiring you for your engineering skills and judgment, not your ability to configure test infrastructure!
