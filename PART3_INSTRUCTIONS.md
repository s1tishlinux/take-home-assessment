# Part 3: Documentation & Architecture (30 minutes)

## Your Tasks

### 1. Project Documentation (15 minutes)
Create a comprehensive `PROJECT_README.md` that includes:
- Project overview and objectives
- Setup and deployment instructions
- API usage examples
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide

### 2. Architecture Documentation (15 minutes)
Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` explaining:
- System architecture and component interactions
- Technology choices and justifications
- Scalability considerations
- Monitoring and alerting strategy
- Future improvement suggestions

## Documentation Requirements

### PROJECT_README.md Structure
```markdown
# ML Model Monitoring System

## Overview
[Brief description of what the system does]

## Quick Start
[Step-by-step setup instructions]

## API Reference
[Endpoint documentation with examples]

## Deployment
[How to deploy to different environments]

## Testing
[How to run tests and validate functionality]

## Troubleshooting
[Common issues and solutions]
```

### ARCHITECTURE.md Structure
```markdown
# System Architecture

## High-Level Architecture
[Diagram or description of system components]

## Component Details
[Detailed explanation of each service]

## Data Flow
[How data moves through the system]

## Technology Decisions
[Why you chose specific technologies]

## Scalability & Performance
[How the system handles scale]

## Monitoring Strategy
[How to monitor the system in production]

## Future Improvements
[What you would add with more time]
```

## Quality Standards

### For PROJECT_README.md
✅ Clear, step-by-step setup instructions  
✅ Working code examples that can be copy-pasted  
✅ Proper formatting with headers and code blocks  
✅ Troubleshooting section with common issues  
✅ API documentation with request/response examples  

### For ARCHITECTURE.md
✅ Clear explanation of design decisions  
✅ Consideration of production requirements  
✅ Discussion of trade-offs made  
✅ Realistic improvement suggestions  
✅ Understanding of scalability challenges  

## Sample Architecture Topics to Address

### System Design
- Why did you choose Flask/FastAPI?
- How does the drift detection algorithm work?
- What are the performance characteristics?

### Production Readiness
- How would you monitor this service?
- What happens when it fails?
- How does it handle high traffic?

### Future Improvements
- What would you add with more time?
- How would you improve reliability?
- What additional monitoring would you implement?
