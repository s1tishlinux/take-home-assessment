# Pipeline and Deployment Fixes

## CI/CD Pipeline Issues Fixed

1. **Dependency Installation Order**
   - **Issue**: `pip install --upgrade pip` was executed after installing requirements
   - **Fix**: Reversed the order to upgrade pip first, then install dependencies

2. **Hardcoded Database Credentials**
   - **Issue**: Database credentials were hardcoded in the pipeline file
   - **Fix**: Moved credentials to GitHub secrets with `${{ secrets.STAGING_DB_URL }}` and `${{ secrets.PROD_DB_URL }}`

3. **Missing Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: No error handling for model training and validation steps
   - **Fix**: Added `continue-on-error: false` and `id` tags to ensure proper error propagation

4. **Conditional Steps**
   - **Issue**: Health check and integration tests run regardless of deployment status
   - **Fix**: Added conditions to only run these steps after successful deployment to relevant environments

5. **Security Issues**
   - **Issue**: API key naming inconsistency between environments
   - **Fix**: Standardized naming to `STAGING_API_KEY` and `PROD_API_KEY` for clarity

6. **Cleanup Step**
   - **Issue**: Aggressive cleanup that might affect other jobs
   - **Fix**: Removed potentially dangerous `docker system prune -af --volumes` and `rm -rf ~/.cache/pip/*`
   - **Fix**: Added `if: always()` to ensure cleanup runs regardless of job status

7. **Script References**
   - **Issue**: References to original scripts instead of fixed versions
   - **Fix**: Updated to use `fixed_deployment.py` instead of `model_deployment.py`

## Deployment Script Issues Fixed

1. **Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: Minimal error handling throughout the script
   - **Fix**: Added comprehensive try/except blocks for all major functions
   - **Fix**: Added proper error logging and return values

2. **Logging**
   - **Issue**: Only used print statements for output
   - **Fix**: Implemented proper Python logging with timestamps and log levels

3. **File Validation**
   - **Issue**: No validation for model file or test data existence
   - **Fix**: Added checks to verify files exist before attempting to use them

4. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - **Issue**: No validation for required environment variables
   - **Fix**: Added checks for API_KEY, MODEL_PATH, and DATABASE_URL

5. **Database Connection**
   - **Issue**: No proper connection handling or cleanup
   - **Fix**: Added proper connection closing in finally blocks

6. **Return Values**
   - **Issue**: Functions didn't return status indicators
   - **Fix**: Added proper return values to indicate success/failure

7. **Exit Codes**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent use of sys.exit()
   - **Fix**: Standardized exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)

8. **API Response Handling**
   - **Issue**: Minimal validation of API responses
   - **Fix**: Added checks for deployment_id in response

9. **Notification Handling**
   - **Issue**: No error handling for notification failures
   - **Fix**: Added try/except for Slack notification with proper logging

10. **Code Organization**
    - **Issue**: Missing docstrings and comments
    - **Fix**: Added function docstrings and improved code organization

## Requirements Issues Fixed

1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - **Issue**: Too many dependencies, some potentially conflicting
   - **Fix**: Organized dependencies by category and commented out optional ones

2. **Version Pinning**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent version pinning strategy
   - **Fix**: Maintained necessary version pins while allowing compatible updates

3. **Unnecessary Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: Included dependencies not needed for core functionality
   - **Fix**: Commented out optional dependencies like tensorflow, torch, kubernetes

4. **Organization**
   - **Issue**: Unorganized list of dependencies
   - **Fix**: Grouped dependencies by function with comments
